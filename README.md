# CSCE883 Salary Prediction Project
************the R code for the Linear Regression we finally used is not in this repo**********
The partial code of a  project which was part of CSCE 883- Machine Learning course at University of South Carolina.

-	The objective was to predict tentative salary for a particular job based on several factors like
Location, Job Description, Job Category, Company etc. The dataset was for jobs in UK. Such a
prediction engine can help users gain an insight into what tentative salary they should be
expected to get.
-	Two key responsibilities- First, to fill in the missing values of the Job Type column by
classifying them into full time or part time jobs. Second was to use the several datasets
generated for individual keywords, and use the predictors in each of these datasets to
predict the final Salary column for each of those keywords.
-	The first part was done using logistic regression and the second part was done using
generalized linear regression. Several techniques like Linear Regression, Text Mining-
Keyword approach, and Random Forests, were used towards the purpose of the project.
Most of the project was done in R, except the text-mining part to extract keywords which
was done in Java.
